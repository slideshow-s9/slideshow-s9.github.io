## How To Create Slides Without Titles?   {#notitle}

You can use the `!SLIDE` directive to create slides without headings.
Example:

~~~
!SLIDE

A slide with no title

!SLIDE

Another slide with no heading

!SLIDE

And another

!SLIDE commandline

    $ ruby print.rb

!SLIDE image 

!i/friendsbadge.png!
~~~

Note, you can pass along CSS style classes to your generated `div`
or `section` that wraps your slide. Example:

~~~
!SLIDE smaller commandline
~~~

Will become:

~~~
<div class='slide smaller commandline'>
  ...
</div>
~~~


## How To Use Gradient Themes for the Built-In S6 Template Pack?   {#themes}

You can define your gradient theme in plain text in the slide show source in the header
using a simple CSS-style name value pair. [More Â»](themes.html#use)


## How To Fetch New Template Packages?  {#fetch}

Using the `install` command lets you fetch (install) new templates. Example:

~~~
$ slideshow install s5blank
~~~

or

~~~
$ slideshow install https://raw.github.com/slideshow-s9/slideshow-s5-blank/master/s5blank.txt
~~~

Resulting in:

~~~
Fetching template package 's5blank' 
  : from 'https://raw.github.com/slideshow-s9/slideshow-s5-blank/master
  : saving to '~/.slideshow/templates/s5blank'
  Downloading manifest 's5blank.txt'... 
  Downloading template 'header.html.erb'... 
  ... 
  Downloading template 'ui/default/slides.js'... 
Done. 
~~~

Note, if you want to store the template pack somewhere else
use the `-c/--config` option (defaults to `~/.slideshow`).

To find more templates browse the [Template Gallery](gallery.html).


### Troubleshooting

Trouble downloading? Do you have a direct internet connection?
If not, configure your proxy using the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. Sample:

~~~
HTTP_PROXY=http://234.445.454:4341
~~~

Or with user credentials (that is, login and password):

~~~
HTTP_PROXY=http://gerald:topsecret@234.445.454:4341
~~~

If all fails, you can always download the template pack on your own
(using lets say `git` itself) and than move the souces into your
templates folder (that is, `~/.slideshow/templates`).


## How To Fetch New Template Packs Using `git`?   {#git}

If you prefer you can fetch template packs using `git` itself in two steps

Step 1: Change to your templates folder

Issue the command:

~~~
cd ~/.slideshow/templates
~~~

Step 2: Clone (Fetch) the template pack using `git`

Let's clone the `slideshow-google-html5-slides` template pack. Issue the command:

~~~
git clone http://github.com/slideshow-s9/slideshow-google-html5-slides.git
~~~

That's it. Use the `list` command to list all installed template packs.

## How To List All Installed Template Packages?   {#list}

Using the `list` command lets you list all installed templates. Example:

~~~
$ slideshow list
~~~

or

~~~
$ slideshow ls
~~~

Resulting in:

~~~
Installed templates include: 
  s5blank.txt       (~/.slideshow/templates/s5blank/s5blank.txt)
  s6.txt            (/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/slideshow-0.8/templates/s6.txt)
~~~


## How To Use Your Own Slide Show Template Packages?   {#templates}

Fetch a sample template pack from the internet or clone it using `git` or create
it from scratch.
See the [Template Gallery](gallery.html) for more info and samples to get started.

To use your own template pack use the `-t/--template MANIFEST` option 
passing along the manifest. Example:

~~~
$ slideshow build microformats -t s6
$ slideshow build microformats -t s5blank
~~~

Got templates? Send a link and announcement to the
[Forum/Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/webslideshow)
and get your link added to the [Template Gallery](gallery.html).


## How To Generate PDF Documents from Your Slide Shows?   {#pdf}

When you generate your slide show as usual with the built-in S6 template pack
you will get an extra `<your_name_here>.pdf.html` document generated that
you can use to generate a PDF-version of your slide show
using lets say the free, open source [`wkhtmltopdf`](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/) tool.

Example:

~~~
$ slideshow build tutorial

$ wkhtmltopdf --outline --orientation Landscape tutorial.pdf.html tutorial.pdf 
~~~


## How To Comment Out Content?   {#comments}

Use `%` for comments anywhere (including headers) and `%begin`/`%end`
for multi-line comments and `%end` to skip everything until the end.

See [10 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know About Ruby](http://raw.github.com/slideshow-s9/samples/master/10things.text)
sample.

Note, as an alternative syntax to skip (comment out)
content in your source enclose it with  `__SKIP__`/`__END__`. Example:

~~~
__SKIP__ 
  not yet ready or private notes/comments 
__END__ 
~~~

As a shortcut if you just use `__END__` (without `__SKIP__`) (Ruby-like)
it will skip everything from `__END__` until the end of the file.
