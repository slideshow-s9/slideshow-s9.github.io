# TODOs

- change all references to gradient themes to
  gradient backgrounds  - why? (avoids confusion with themes as used in other tools)

- change themes.md to gradients.md ? or backgrounds ??

- update samples (from textile to markdown)

- update tutorial (use new text e.g. just markdown; no word about wiki, etc. use write instead of create/author etc.)
